/*
 * WAD support routines for PhysicsFS.
 *
 * This driver handles DOOM engine archives ("wads"). 
 * This format (but not this driver) was designed by id Software for use
 *  with the DOOM engine.
 * The specs of the format are from the unofficial doom specs v1.666
 * found here: http://www.gamers.org/dhs/helpdocs/dmsp1666.html
 * The format of the archive: (from the specs)
 *
 *  A WAD file has three parts:
 *  (1) a twelve-byte header
 *  (2) one or more "lumps"
 *  (3) a directory or "info table" that contains the names, offsets, and
 *      sizes of all the lumps in the WAD
 *
 *  The header consists of three four-byte parts:
 *    (a) an ASCII string which must be either "IWAD" or "PWAD"
 *    (b) a 4-byte (long) integer which is the number of lumps in the wad
 *    (c) a long integer which is the file offset to the start of
 *    the directory
 *
 *  The directory has one 16-byte entry for every lump. Each entry consists
 *  of three parts:
 *
 *    (a) a long integer, the file offset to the start of the lump
 *    (b) a long integer, the size of the lump in bytes
 *    (c) an 8-byte ASCII string, the name of the lump, padded with zeros.
 *        For example, the "DEMO1" entry in hexadecimal would be
 *        (44 45 4D 4F 31 00 00 00)
 * 
 * Note that there is no way to tell if an opened WAD archive is a
 *  IWAD or PWAD with this archiver.
 * I couldn't think of a way to provide that information, without being too
 *  hacky.
 * I don't think it's really that important though.
 *
 *
 * Please see the file LICENSE.txt in the source's root directory.
 *
 * This file written by Travis Wells, based on the GRP archiver by
 *  Ryan C. Gordon.
