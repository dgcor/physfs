Stuff that needs to be done and wishlist:

These are in no particular order.
Some might be dupes, some might be done already, some might be bad ideas.


From http://icculus.org/pipermail/physfs/2009-March/000698.html ...

- Archives formats provided by the implementation.
- Write support for various archives. I haven't decided how to do this yet,
  but I'd like to.
- Add an API to expose a file's extended attributes to the application?
- Deprecate PHYSFS_setSaneConfig(). It really should have been in the extras
  directory.
- Clean up the sources to match my ever-changing coding style. :)


From http://icculus.org/pipermail/physfs/2010-January/000821.html ...

- Plugin system for the archive handlers


From http://icculus.org/pipermail/physfs/2010-January/000826.html ...

- Lua bindings


From http://icculus.org/pipermail/physfs/2010-January/000833.html ...

- SWIG bindings



From old TODO.txt...

- Other archivers: perhaps tar(.gz|.bz2), RPM, ARJ, etc. These are less
  important, since streaming archives aren't of much value to games (which
  is why zipfiles are king: random access), but it could have uses for, say,
  an installer/updater.
- profile string list interpolation.
- We have two different ways to find dir entries in zip.c.
- Do symlinks in zip archiver work when they point to dirs?
- Enable more warnings?
- Use __cdecl in physfs.h?
- Look for FIXMEs (many marked with "!!!" in comments).
- Find some way to relax or remove the security model for external tools.
- fscanf and fprintf support in extras dir.
- Sanity check byte order at runtime.
- Memory locking?
- General code audit.
- Multiple write dirs with mount points?
- Replace code from SDL...
- Should file enumeration return an error or set error state?
- Write up a simple HOWTO on embedding physicsfs in another project.


Other stuff I thought of...
- moar asserts!
- constify!
- Does iPhone work?
- Fix CMake vs Doxygen.
- Doxygen replacement? (manpages suck.)
- Fix coding standards to match.
- See if we can ditch some #include lines...
- We lost Vista symlink support when removing isSymLink(). Pull it back from
  revision control.
- PHYSFS_exists() fails if you mountIo with a NULL filename. We need to decide
  how this API should work.
- ZIP64 support?
- LZMA support in zip archiver?
- bzip2 support in zip archiver?
- rewrite 7zip archiver.
- ryanify iso9660 code.
- Reduce the BAIL and GOTO macro use. A lot of these don't add anything.
- Modernize CMakeLists.txt
- Change the term "search path" to something less confusing.

Probably other stuff. Requests and recommendations are welcome.
