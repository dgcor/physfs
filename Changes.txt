This fork of PhysicsFS adds MPQ files support through
StormLib from Ladislav Zezula.

The changes are mainly in archiver_mpq.c
Only read only support is implemented.

You enable MPQ support in CMake using

PHYSFS_ARCHIVE_MPQ

If you want to use an external StormLib (the embedded one
only reads MPQ v1 archives), use the option

PHYSFS_USE_EXTERNAL_STORMLIB
