These are the build instructions for PhysicsFS for Android.
The Android makefile defines the following formats:

7ZIP, MPQ, ZIP

Copy the /src folder here. You should have this folder structure:

src/*
Android.mk
BUILD.txt

Rename this folder (android to physfs) and copy it to your Android NDK's sources folder.

Add the following to the Android.mk of your project:

LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES += libphysfs

$(call import-module,physfs)
